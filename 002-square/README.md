There is a two dimensional array (arr) with width d and height h.
The arr only contains 0 or 1. Given arr, compute area of largest
square with only 1.

First line is h, w splitted with space.
Subsequent lines are the arr.

    Example input 1:
    1 1
    1
    
    Output: 1
    
    Example input 2:
    1 1
    0
    
    Output: 0
    
    Example input 3:
    3 6
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 1 1 1
    0 0 0 1 1 1
    
    Output: 4
